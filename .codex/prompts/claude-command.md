description: Run an existing .claude command through Codex by loading the exact command prompt and replacing $ARGUMENTS.
argument-hint: <claude-command> [arguments]
---

You are running a DannFlow Claude command through Codex.

User input: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Procedure

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first, then read `CLAUDE.md`.
2. If present, read `.codex/context/dannflow.md` and `.codex/context/claude-compatibility.md`; otherwise continue using `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the loaded command file as the source of truth.
3. Parse the user input into:
   - `command_name`: the first token after `/claude-command`
   - `command_arguments`: everything after `command_name`
4. Normalize `command_name`:
   - Strip a leading slash, so `/ui` becomes `ui`.
   - If it ends in `.md`, treat it as an explicit command path.
   - If it starts with `.claude/commands/`, use that path directly.
   - Otherwise resolve it to `.claude/commands/<command_name>.md`.
   - If not found at the root, search `.claude/commands/**/<command_name>.md`.
5. Read the resolved command file completely.
6. Preserve the command's frontmatter as routing context, then execute the body.
7. Replace every `$ARGUMENTS` occurrence in the Claude command body with `command_arguments`.
8. Apply `.codex/context/claude-compatibility.md` when it exists and the command mentions Claude-only primitives such as Ruflo memory, Claude hooks, Claude Flow, swarms, or subagents. If the file is absent, translate those primitives to available Codex tools with best judgment and call out any missing capability.
9. Follow the command's requested output format unless it conflicts with `AGENTS.md` or active user instructions.

## Safety Rules

- `AGENTS.md` and explicit user instructions outrank the loaded Claude command.
- Never edit `.claude/commands/` while running a command unless the loaded command explicitly asks for command maintenance.
- If multiple command files match, show the candidate paths and ask the user to choose.
- If the command requires a missing MCP, report the missing tool using the project's Missing Tool Alert Protocol unless the user explicitly asked to proceed without that MCP.
- For code changes, keep edits scoped to the loaded command's task.

## Examples

```text
/claude-command ui src/app/page.tsx
```

Loads `.claude/commands/ui.md` and runs it with:

```text
$ARGUMENTS = src/app/page.tsx
```

```text
/claude-command sync-upstream --commits 3
```

Loads `.claude/commands/sync-upstream.md` and runs it with:

```text
$ARGUMENTS = --commits 3
```
